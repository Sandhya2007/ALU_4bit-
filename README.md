# 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

This is a Verilog-based 4-bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) designed and simulated using **Vivado 2024.1**.  
The ALU performs various arithmetic and logical operations and is suitable for educational and RTL design practice.

---

## 🔧 Features

- 4-bit **Addition**, **Subtraction**
- Logical **AND**, **OR**, **XOR**
- **Left Shift**, **Right Shift**
- **Zero flag** and **carry handling**

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Vivado 2024.1** (by Xilinx)
- Verilog HDL
- Git & GitHub for version control
